## A04 - ADFGX Implementation
### Dulan Dunusinghe
### Description:

The ADFGX cipher was a field cipher used by the German Army during World War I. It is closely related to the ADFGVX cipher. ADFGX is a fractionating transposition cipher which combined a modified Polybius square with a single columnar transposition. The cipher is named after the five possible letters used in the ciphertext: A, D, F, G and X. These letters were chosen deliberately because they sound very different from each other when transmitted via morse code. The intention was to reduce the possibility of operator error.Ultimately write a program that implements the steps described in this document to implement the ADFGX cipher. Your program should include functions that implement various components of the cipher to encrypt and decrypt. Basically, organize your code into functions and / or classes. Any characters that are not A-Z can be ignored and filtered out. But they need to be handled and should not break your program. Use of external libraries is OK as long as you document thier use and as long as you still implement the actual algorithm.
Key components are:
01)ENCRYPTION 
02)DECRYPTION
