## Assignment 5 - Vigenere Cracking
### Dulan Dunusinghe
### Description:

You will be given 1 or more encrypted files. You know the files were encrypted using the VigenÃ¨re method. You also know that the key used is an english dictionary word with a length 2-16 inclusive.Write a python program that will 1) discover the size of that dictionary word (keylength) and then determine which word was used to encrypt your file(s).

To find the keylength you can use the Index of Coincidence (I.C.) described breifly below, but more thoroughly at the link provided.
